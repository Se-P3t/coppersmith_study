    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "An important application of lattice basis reduction is finding small solutions to polynomial equations $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod N$ of degree $d > 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, finding solutions to modular equations is easy if we know the factorisation of the modulus. However, if the factorisation of the modulus $N$ is not known then finding solutions can be hard. Indeed, notice that for some polynomials, it is equivalent to the knowledge of the factorization of $N$. Hence, we do not expect efficient algorithms for finding all solutions to modular equations in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose then that the polynomial equation has a \"small\" solution. It is not so clear that finding the roots is necessarily a hard problem. As we will explain later, if $f(x) \\equiv 0 \\pmod N$ of degree $d$ has a solution $x^{(0)}$ such that $|x^{(0)}| < N^{1/d−\\epsilon}$ for small $\\epsilon > 0$ then it can be found in polynomial-time. This result has a number of important consequences.\n",
